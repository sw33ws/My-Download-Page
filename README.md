# My-Download-Page

This is a download page, where i'm uploading  a large number of my projects as exe files!

The files themself are saved on a google drive, but do not require you to go to my google drive page, just click the click and your good!

You can vist the live site [Here!](https://sw33ws.github.io/My-Download-Page/)

The google drive link download trick was learned from a helpful Paperform video [Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYm03K7weKA), check him out if you have the time!
